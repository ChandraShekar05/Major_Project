# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras

This project is a Credit Card Fraud Detection system built using Autoencoders in Keras. The system identifies fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Detects fraudulent transactions using Autoencoders.
- Supports two datasets: `creditcard.csv` and `filtered_creditcard.csv`.
- Provides statistical analysis with visualizations (pie charts and bar graphs).
- Allows users to fetch transaction details and predict fraud likelihood.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Chart.js (for frontend visualizations)
- A web browser (to view the application)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
   python public/app.py
